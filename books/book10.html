        <h3>WHERE THE SUN NEVER SETS</h3>
        <p>It all began on 24th March 2020, Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Government of India ordered a national lockdown that lasted approximately three months, restricting the movement of India's entire population of 1.3 billion. It was a protective measure
            against the Covid-19 pandemic. <p> On 2 June 2020. I woke up to 2020's biggest fear- a family member testing positive for covid-19 and the inability to be with them due to the lockdown. I recieved a phone call at 9.am, and my mom told me that she had tested positive and that
            a team of six people had entered my parents apartment in the city of Indore to sanitize every corner of it. Mind you, these were not the times of no proven treatments and confusion. <p>In the week following this, I wrote a blog post that went viral and helped many people get a 
            much needed dose of positivity against this unknown monster. But what many people don't know is how daunting it was for me to live for a month in the constant fear of losing my mother. On most nights, I was anxious, depressed and besieged by hopelessness. <p>In fact, when she finally tested negative 
            after a month, I could not travel to Indore for a few more months as Covid-19 cases had started exploding, with the maximum cases being reported by July end. I feared becoming a carrier and the possiblity of her or any other family member contracting the infection. <p>Those were some of the most challenging times of my
            life, even if they were pretty unique too.I realized that the only thing that would make me happy was being with my mother. Most of all, I realized that only some people stood by my side during crisis.
