        <h3>HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHONEIX</h3>
        <p>The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square housees of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emarald green
           lay parched and yellowing - for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade if their cool houses, 
           windows thrown wide in left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four. <p>He was a skinny, black haired bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slighty unhealthy look of someone who has grown 
            a lot in short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and fade, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter's apperance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people
            who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
            stuck their head out the living room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below. <p>On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulaed on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth 
            but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened everytime.
