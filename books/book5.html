        <h3>JACK MARS PRIMARY THREAT</h3>
        <p>No one was ready when the killing started. <p>Moments before, the man they called Big Dog stood at the rail in quilt-lined coveralls, steel-toed boots, thick leather gloves, and a faded yellow baseball cap that said Hunt Hard across the front. <p> It was cold out, but the didn't feel the cold as it was going to be.
           All around him was the vastness of the Artic-gray sky, dark water punctuated with the bright white ice, as far as the eye could see. <p>He smoked a cigarette and watched a double-hulled personel boat working it's way towards the ice floes in the bleak light of the late afternoon. You couldn't call it sunlight. The cloud cover was constant 
           now, like a heavy blanket, and Big Dog hadn't seen a pack a peak of sunlight in at least a week. It was easy to lose track of sun. It was easy to lose track of everything.
           <p>"They're early", Big Dog said out loud to himself. <p>That boat didn't sit quite right with him. It gave him an uncertain feeling in his gut. It looked a lot like a boat that would bring crew members out to the rig after a break. in fact, from here he could make out at least a dozen men on the deck of the boat, preparing to disembark when they 
            rech the dock. But the shift changes didn't happen early, and the boats didn't happen early, and the boats didn't appeared unscheduled and unannounced.</p></p>
