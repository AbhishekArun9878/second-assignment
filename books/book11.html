        <h3>ON THE OPEN ROAD: 3 LIVES 5 CITIES 1 DREAM</h3>
        <p>I enter the eighteen-storeyed building at 12:30 A.M as the work demands staying back at times. 'Never argue with the boss, so you can be the lucky one who wins an early
            ticket to the on-site office', seniors at the IT factory had suggested to the new hires. They never explained at the cost of what though. Sleep. We figured out soon enough! <p>My abode is a tiny corner in the eleventh floor of the Shri Krishna Co-op Housing Society in the 
            ever expanding suburbs of Bnadra where young professionals, college students and refugees rehabitated by the local government find a home. It hasn't been more than ten minutes since I entered the house when the doorbell started ringing incessantly, typical of Saurabh from the 
            good old engineering days. I eye the door, annoyed beyond belief. <p>Why is Saurabh here? His ailing mother used the ultimate Bollywood-esque weapon, 'Beta! I think I am going to pass away anytime now', on repeat over Skype. The aftermath? He is back in India and visits us often.
            Even though I am in no mood to listen to what Saurabh has to say, I won't have an option in five minutes from now when he enters the apartment! Sigh, <p>'Please go and get that one!' Rhea my roomate, yells, 'It's your turn;. 'I will return the favour someday'. 'You never will!' She gives 
            into my lazy attitude and escorts Saurabh to the living room. I lie on the couch eyes fixed on the laptop. 'Hey, How's work?'. He asserts, 'Fantastic'.
