        <h3>JACK MARS ROGUE FORCE</h3>
        <p>Almost nothing about the man was it appeared. He seemed tall, a bit over six feet, but he was wearing two inch lifts inside his fine leather boots,
            which themselves had one-inch heels. He seemed to have a thich blonde beard. In fact, it was a cleverly crafted fake, glued to his face with the skill and care that 
            Hollywood cosmetic specialists use when working on film actors. <p> He seemed to have long blonde hair, tied in a ponytail. Same. The wig was high-quality as the beardand affixed to his head 
            with equal care . The fact, his head was closely shaven, his real hair was dark and, it allowed to grow out, would show him to be a victim of early male pattern balding. He wore colored contact lenses
            to make his brown eyes seem pale blue. His eyebrows were dyed blonde and could easily and quickly be dyed back to their normal color. <p>He often went by the name "Sven". He had no idea why, but he foundthis amusing.
            Perhaps because he was far from a Nordic Sven as humanly possible, both physically and in outlook. He also found it amusing how a man like him, want some might call a true believer in nothing but the material world that 
            he could touch and see. <p>He shook his head and smiled. It helped that the pay was good. Very good. <p> He left the car in the parking lot and walked across the grass to the far southern corner of the park.</p></p>
