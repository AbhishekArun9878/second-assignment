        <h3>THE PORTRAIT OF A SECRET: A NOVEL INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS</h3>
        <p>He walked towards the washroom, his hands trembling in fear. His heart thuddled rapidly, the sound reverbing loudly in his ears, drowning out the usual cacophony of clacking type-writers and shrill telephone around him. His hands, wet with guilty sweat,
            struggled to turn the knob, forcing him to grab it with both hands and wrestle it open. <p>He lokked around, finding some self-control in the emptiness of the washroom. He took several deep calming breathes, releasing a part of his anxiety with such exhalation.
            He touched the inside pocket of his polyster suit jacket, feeling the reassuring weight of his equipment, his strength of purpose re-emerging from amid his muddled thoughts. He entered one of the stalls-the sound of the latch falling in place providing him with 
            an additional sense of security. <p>He pulled out the pencil case, given to him for the purpose, and placed it gingerly on the now-closed lid of the pot. From his trouser pocket, he retrived an immaculately clean white handkerchief and spred it next to the pencil 
            case. Reaching into his pocket again, he gingerly drew out the papers that he had lifted from his supervisor's desk and laid them neatly on the handkerchief. His practised fingers slid it open the secret compartment of the pencil case that contained the camera lens
            and activated the battery that powered the system. Carefully but swiftly, he photographed each page, the camera working soundlessly, as it had been designed to do by it's American manufacturers. His works complete, he returned the papers to his breast pocket and retrived the camera to a boring pencil
            case, replacing it in his pocket.
