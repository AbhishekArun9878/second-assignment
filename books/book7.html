        <h3>HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS</h3>
        <p>Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at the number four, Privet Drive. Mr Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noice 
           from his nephew Harry's room. <p>Third time this week! he roared across the table. 'If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go!'. Harry tried, yet again, to explain. "She's bored, he said. 'She is used to flying around outside.
            If I could just let her out at night...'. 'Do I look stupid?' snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy moustache. 'I know what'll happen if that owl's let out. <p>He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried 
           to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud beltch from the Dusleys' son Dudley. 'I want more bacon'.There's more in the frying pan, sweetums, said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. 'We must feed you up while we've got the chance...
           I don't like the sound of that school food'. <p>Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at the Smeltings, said Uncle Vernon heartly. 'Dudley gets enough, don't you son? Dudley, who was so large his bottom dropped over either side of the kitchen chair, ginned and turned to Harry.
            'Pass the frying pan'. 'You've forgotten the magic word', said Harry irritably. The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible.
