        <h3>POLLY'S HAVEN: SCARY HORROR STORY</h3>
        <p>"This is a safe place."<p>"If you say that one more time, doctor, I'm going to walk out <p>Pauline's eyes were closed for the past twenty minutes. The sound of the old grandfather clock ticking away in the corner, her only attached to walking the world. She felt the coolness of the the air conditioner on her face. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail she regularly wore these days,
            her suite jacket thrown on a couch across the room. She felt relaxed, more so than at home, and wondered if the man sitting across from her would mind if she just slept through the rest of their regular weekly set hour. <p>" It's just that you haven't said a word since you walked in." Paulgine sighed. "I haven't said much of anything for the past month. <p>"Which isn't helping?" Pauline heard the shuffling of paper and the beginning of a pen's rhythmic tapping that accompanied her doctor's slow loss of patience. "You know you can't go back to work until we're through here". <p>Pauline sighted again. If she were completly
              honest with herself, not going back to work suddenly sounded well. But she couldn't say that out loud; not here.
