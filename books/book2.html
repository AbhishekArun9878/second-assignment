        <h3>HORROR STORIES: SCARY GHOSTS, PARANORMAL & SUPERNATURAL ENTITIES</h3>
        <p>Night had fallen, and the air was cool. A few birds continued to sing from their nests in the tall pines along the roadside. Wendy's footsteps were loud in her ears as she walked.
          The road was unfamiliar to her, as was the neighbourhood, itself. Her new apartment was two miles back the way she had come, and she still had another mile to go before she reaches her
          turn-around point. She kept a steady pace, her fanny-pack bouncing rhythmically against her behind. <p> The occasional car raced passed, some of them moving away from the shoulder of the road
            and others staying close. Wendy's reflective safety vest and blinking light seemed only to the alert the drivers who were actually paying attention to the road. It was a roll of the dice 
            whether or not she would be hit every time by a car came by, but she didn't mind. <p> The weather was pleasant, and it was good to get outside, away from her computer and the constant research. She began whisling to herself as she approached to closed off road to an old campground. 
          A rusting chain stretched across the cracked pavement of the entrance was lopped around two pine trees. From the chain's sagging center, a faded sign reading "NO TRESPASSING" hung limply. There was no breeze to move it. As Wendy drew closer, she heard a curious sound. Almost as though
          someone, or something was shuffling around her.
