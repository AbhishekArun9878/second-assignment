        <h3>JACK MARS PRIMARY DUTY</h3>
        <p>"Where is he now?" Jaffar Idrissi said <p> The two men made their way together along the bleak alleys, between the tumbledown wood and the cement dwelling of the largest shanty town in Europe.
            The morning was cold and overcast, and a chill ran up Jaafar's back, despite his wind breaker jacket and the sweater he wore underneath. <p>It had rained last night, and the fetid puddles of brown water remained in the pitted earth of the 
            walking path . These people had neither electricity nor running water in their homes. The two men walked through this hellish compound not because they lived here, but because it was a good place to talk 
            and not be overheard. The residents here were too hopeless to concern themseleves with a talk to others. And the police rarely bothered to make their way through this maze of despair. <p>Up ahead, a group 
            of children were playing on three makeshift slides. The slides were made of what appeared to be large PVC plastic pipes, cut in half legthwise. The pipes were pitched up against a mound of dirt and junk. At the 
            top was a pile of discarded car and truck tires that the children climbed up to enter the mouth of each tube. At the bottom was a pile of discarded car and truck tires that the children climbed up to enter the mouth of
            each tube. At the bottom was a mound of sand trucked in from somewhere. The sand had become a thick yellow muck from the rain.
