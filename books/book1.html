                <h3>THIS IS GONNA HURT: SCARY HORROR SHORT STORY</h3>
                <p>"This is gonna hurt". Philip took a long drap from his cigarette as he stared off into space. The blisters on his hands were slowly starting to make themselves known, screaming at him with pain, but he fought it back. What he had achieved over the past few hours was worth the pain in the world. His exhaustion didn't matter.</p>
                <p>What mattered was now. Only now.</p>
                <p>He took another drag and blew out smoke rings nonchalantly, knowing he had all the time in the world for the next steps. He crossed the open space of his garage, slowly counting his steps and watching the prints his feet made in the thick layer of dust that collected over the years since he'd been down here. The nostalgia was refreshing.</p>
                <p>He had bought the house years before, back when he thought he had it all. He was supposed to get married here, have children and raise them in a quiet neighborhood. A heaven away from home, he had called it. Now that's all in the past. His eyes watered when he thought about what could have been. Still, this wasn't going to be easy. The scratching of the chair against the floor brought him back to the present. He didn't turn around. He didn't need to. He knew, all too well, what was happening. It had taken months to prepare, and now he was at the final stages
                    of what he liked to call - his final showdown, a sense of relief washed over him.
