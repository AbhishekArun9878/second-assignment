        <h3>HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE</h3>
        <p>It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone in his office, reading a long memo that was sitting alone in his office, reading a memo that was slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace
           of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the president of far-distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring 
           and difficult week, there was not much space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the could see the gloating face of his political opponents. This particular
           opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and everyone of them was the government's fault.
           <p>The Prime Minister's pulse quickend at the very thought of these accusations, for they were netiher fair nor true. How on earth was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that 
            they were not spending enough on bridges. The bridge was less than ten years old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen into the watery depts of the river below.And how dared anyone suggest
            that it was lack of policemen that had resulted in those two nasty and well-publicised murders? Or that the government should have somehow foreseen freak hurricane in the West Country that had caused so much damage to both people and the property?
